Supported SongBeamer versions
=============================

Currently only version Songbeamer version 2 is supported. (Internal version
number in .sng files: ``#Version=3``.)

I do not have access to other SongBeamer versions so I do not know the file
structure there.

At least Python 3.2 is required.

Running Tests
